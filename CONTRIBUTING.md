## Quick Start
**New to open source?** No problem! Here's the simplest way to contribute:
1. **Found a typo?** Just open an issue or submit a PR with the fix
2. **Have an idea?** Share it in the issues - we'd love to hear it!
3. **Want to code?** Look for `good first issue` labels
4. **Not sure?** Just ask! There are no silly questions

## Ways to Contribute
### Reporting Bugs
Found something broken? Let us know! 
Just open an [issue](https://github.com/htmlforge-team/HtmlForge/issues) and tell us:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Any error messages you saw
**Example:**
> I tried to add an image but got a NullPointerException when the alt text was null.
That's it! Feel free to add more details if you want (Java version, code sample, etc.), but a simple description is totally fine.
### Suggesting Ideas
Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? We'd love to hear it!
Open an issue and describe your idea. It doesn't need to be formal - just explain what you're thinking and why it would be helpful.
**Example:**
> It would be cool if we could add tables. I'm building a dashboard and need to display data in a grid format.
### Improving Documentation
Spot a typo? Think something could be explained better? Documentation improvements are always welcome!
You can edit files directly on GitHub by clicking the pencil icon, or clone the repo and submit a PR.
### Contributing Code
Want to add a feature or fix a bug? Awesome! Here's the general flow:
1. **Fork the repo** and create a branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix-something-cool
   ```
2. **Make your changes** - write your code!
3. **Test it** - make sure it works
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```
4. **Submit a PR** - we'll review it and work with you to get it merged
Don't stress about getting everything perfect. We're happy to help you refine your contribution!
### Adding a Theme
Love design? Create a custom theme! Check out the [themes directory](themes/) for examples.
1. Create a new folder in `themes/YourThemeName/`
2. Add a `style.css` file
3. Test it out
4. Submit a PR with some screenshots
See [Creating Custom Themes](#creating-custom-themes) below for more details.

## Development Setup
### What You Need
- **Java 21+** - [Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- **Kotlin 1.9+** (recommended) - the project source is Kotlin-based
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
### Getting Started
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/htmlforge-team/HtmlForge.git
cd HtmlForge
# Build it
./gradlew build
# Run the example
./gradlew run
# Check the generated HTML
open generated/index.html
```
That's it! You're ready to code.

## Code Guidelines (Optional)
These are guidelines, not rules! We won't reject your PR if you don't follow these perfectly. We can always refine things together.
### General Kotlin Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (most IDEs do this by default)
- Try to keep lines under 120 characters
- Prefer idiomatic Kotlin: use `val` for immutable properties, prefer expression bodies, data classes where appropriate, and extension functions for small utilities
**Example:**
```kotlin
// Good ✓
class Paragraph(private val content: String) : Element {
    fun toHtml() = "<p>$content</p>\n"
}
// Also fine - we can help you refactor if needed
class Paragraph(var text: String) : Element {
    fun toHtml(): String { return "<p>$text</p>\n" }
}
```
### Writing Tests
If you're adding new functionality, tests are helpful but not required for your first PR. We can work on them together!
Here's a simple example if you want to try:
```kotlin
@Test
fun toHtml_SimpleText_Works() {
    val p = Paragraph("Hello")
    assertEquals("<p>Hello</p>", p.toHtml())
}
```
### Commit Messages
Write commit messages however feels natural to you. Here are some examples:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix image bug"
git commit -m "Add table element"
git commit -m "Update README typo"
```
That's perfectly fine! If you want to be more descriptive, that's cool too:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix NullPointerException in Image element
The alt text wasn't being validated, causing crashes
when null values were passed. Added a check and test."
```

## Creating Custom Themes
Want to contribute a theme? Awesome! Themes are just CSS files, so it's super easy.
### Quick Theme Setup
1. **Create a folder**: `themes/YourThemeName/`
2. **Add CSS**: Create `style.css` with your styles
3. **Test it**: Apply it to a test HTML file
4. **Submit**: Open a PR with some screenshots
### Theme Tips
- Make it mobile-friendly (use media queries)
- Ensure good contrast for readability
- Style all the common elements (h1-h6, p, a, etc.)
- Have fun with it!
**Example Theme:**
```css
/* themes/Ocean/style.css */
body {
    font-family: 'Georgia', serif;
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #e0f7fa, #ffffff);
    color: #006064;
    padding: 2rem;
}
h1 { 
    color: #00838f;
    border-bottom: 3px solid #00acc1;
}
a {
    color: #0097a7;
    text-decoration: none;
}
a:hover {
    color: #00838f;
}
```
